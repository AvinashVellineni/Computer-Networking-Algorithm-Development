The objective of this project is to design a new fragmentation protocol that:

1. Finds an optimal MTU that enables fragmentation of an original packet at a source node only, i.e. the resulting fragments must NOT be fragmented again at intermediate nodes.

2. Determines the next hop IP address for these fragments as they travel to the destination.
